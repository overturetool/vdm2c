VDM2C is documented in the [Overture tool's user manual](http://overturetool.org/documentation/manuals.html).

A tutorial on how to use VDM2C's distribution feature is documented in the [INTO-CPS deliverable D5.3d, section 5.4](https://svn.nfit.au.dk/svn/iha_pgl-INTOCPS/WP5/T5_4_CodeGen/D5.3d_INTO_FMI_CodeGen/D5.3d-INTO-FMI-Codegen.pdf).
